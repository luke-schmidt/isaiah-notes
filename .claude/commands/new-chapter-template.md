alright. let's create a new chapter file for 10:5-34. I want it to be modeled after the isaiah-9-8-21 file where it includes the the leftRightGrid for 9:8-10:34 but with the right highlighted.

I want then the `overview` component of this chapter file to include an `overviewsection`  the following sections:
* Verses 5-15: Assyria is coming
    * Verses 16-19: Therefore #1: Yahweh will burn up Assyria but a remnant will remain
        * Verses 20-23: A remnant of Israel will trust Yahweh
    * Verses 24-27: Therefore #2: Don't be afraid of Assyria
* Verses 28-34: Assyria is coming

I want to highlight some common words as well. Let's highlight:
* "Woe" in grey
* "staff", "rod", "rod and lift up their staff", "lifts it", "lift him", "lift it" all highlightbrown
* "Hands", "hand", "fist" in purple
* "Therefore" in blue
* "remnant" in orange
* "LORD of Hosts" in yellow

I'd like each of the 5 sections to have their own
biblicaloutline (no subsection headers for now)

I'd like footnotes on the following words:
* "take spoil and seize plunder" in v6 – "Shalal Shalal Baz Baz"
* "finished" in v12 – "Lit. "Cut off" – Motyer says it's a tailoring/weaving term. Like snipping off of a thread."
* "found" in v14 – "Reached"
* "wealth of the peoples" in v14 – "Compare with v10 what else His hand has reached to"
* "earth" in v23 – "Land"
* "fat" in v27 – "or "oil" – confusing in the Hebrew as well. Could be a picture of an ox so fat from such little work that the yoke breaks
* "fist" in v32 – "Hand"

I'd like placeholder notes for the following topics:
* "Hand Still Stretched Out" – read Ex. 6:6 and Deut 4:34. The stretched out hand can be the power to save or the power to judge
* "Devoured" – Seeing the repeated phrases around eating/swallowing up, we can see what Israel's leaders are doing to their vulnerable is put on analogy to what the Syrians and Philistines are doing to Israel. This gets shown more explicitly in the final section of this passage.
* "God has no compassion on Poor?" – The opposite of taking care of them is teaching lies and leading astray. Even those who are supposed to be cared for are led to moral corruption by the leaders. Kind of like how the prosperity gospel of today feeds on the vulnerable and leads them away from the truth.
* "Who's Doing This?" – In v18-21 we see a pattern that started all the way back in the early chapters of Genesis: God's wrath being evidenced as handing people over to their own desires (we can cross reference that passage in the flood story that says this).

I also have 4 pictures of a sycamore, lebanon cedar, dressed stones (Ashlar), and sun dried bricks (mud bricks). That I'd like to include here as well
