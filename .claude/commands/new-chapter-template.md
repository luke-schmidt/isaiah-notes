alright. let's create a new chapter file for 10:5-34. I want it to be modeled after this isaiah-9-8-21 file where it includes the the leftRightGrid for 9:8-10:34 but with the right highlighted.

I want then the `overview` component of this chapter file to include an `overviewsection`  the following sections:
* Verses 5-15: Assyria is coming
    * Verses 16-19: Therefore #1: Yahweh will burn up Assyria
        * Verses 20-23:
    * 
* 

I want to highlight some common words as well. Let's highlight:
* "devour Israel with an open mouth", "swallowed up", "mouth", "devour", "devours" (3x) all highlightbrown
* "For all this....stretched out still" (3x) in highlightorange
* "Ephriam" (3x) in highlightyellow
* "fire" in highlightred

I'd like each of the 3 sections to have their own
biblicaloutline (no subsection headers for now)

I'd like footnotes on the following words:
* "word" in v8 – "Septuigent – "plague/death""
* "Philistines on the west" – "C.f. Amos 1:6 – Could be figurative or they could've been involved in capturing the fleeing Israelites during Assyrian invasion"
* "arm" – "Septuigent – "Brother"; Could also be interpreted "seed""

I'd like placeholder notes for the following topics:
* "Hand Still Stretched Out" – read Ex. 6:6 and Deut 4:34. The stretched out hand can be the power to save or the power to judge
* "Devoured" – Seeing the repeated phrases around eating/swallowing up, we can see what Israel's leaders are doing to their vulnerable is put on analogy to what the Syrians and Philistines are doing to Israel. This gets shown more explicitly in the final section of this passage.
* "God has no compassion on Poor?" – The opposite of taking care of them is teaching lies and leading astray. Even those who are supposed to be cared for are led to moral corruption by the leaders. Kind of like how the prosperity gospel of today feeds on the vulnerable and leads them away from the truth.
* "Who's Doing This?" – In v18-21 we see a pattern that started all the way back in the early chapters of Genesis: God's wrath being evidenced as handing people over to their own desires (we can cross reference that passage in the flood story that says this).

I also have 4 pictures of a sycamore, lebanon cedar, dressed stones (Ashlar), and sun dried bricks (mud bricks). That I'd like to include here as well
