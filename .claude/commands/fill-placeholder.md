description: Fill in a placeholder
---


## Context

We are generating study notes for the book of Isaiah in LaTeX. The current process is starting with text outline and some placeholder notes that then gradually get filled in.

## Your task

You will find the first placeholder note in the chapter text given (take the reference and search under `chapters/` for the right .tex file). Placeholders are usually designated with the word "placeholder" and some brackets.

When filling out the placeholder, see if there's any extra details passed in to this command. If not, take the general placeholder text and add details as you see fit that will then be reviewed later. If extra details are passed in, try to fit them within the placeholder outline as closely as possible.
