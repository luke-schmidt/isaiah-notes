description: Add a new LaTeX component
---


## Context

We are generating study notes for the book of Isaiah in LaTeX. We're trying to make this modular and to do so that involves the use of components.

Our components are found under @styles/components/ and you must place this component there.

## Your task

Create a component based on the description being asked.

Whenever creating a new component YOU MUST create three screenshot images of three different "takes" on the component being asked. I, the one asking for the new component, will then evaluate which of the three options I like the best. You will create these images in a temporary folder. After I select which one I like, you will clean up the temporary folder and the code written for the unused components.
