# Isaiah Study Notes

A LaTeX-based assortment of study notes for the book of Isaiah

## Structure

### PDFs
The combined pdf of all notes in the [chapters/](./chapters/) folders are found in [main.pdf](./main.pdf).

Each individual section's pdf can also be found in the corresponding [chapters/](./chapters/) folder.

Generating the combined pdf still happens manually with running `python3 combine_pdfs.py` but I should probably set that up as a GHA or something to do it automatically.

### Styles
I honestly don't know LaTeX at all so I'm making claude code work with it like it's a componentized-front end. I'm building out a components library of sorts in the `styles/` but not sure if that's how you're supposed to do this kind of thing or not.
