# Intro
alright. let's fill out 15:1-16:14 similar to our other chapters. Let's use the ESV text like we already do everywhere else in this repo. You know what the text is so you don't need to look it up. I'll even start it for you, "
  Isaiah 15
1 An oracle concerning Moab.
Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night,
	Moab is undone;
because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night,
	Moab is undone."

# Structure
 Let's add a threeBoxGrid component like we do in isaiah 10 with these 3 sections:
  * Oracle against Moab - 15:1-9
   * Moab running to Zion - 16:1-5
  * Let Moab Wail - 16:6-14

Whenever we're moving on to the next section, highlight the appropriate part of this threeBoxGrid.

Here's how I'd like each of these three subsections to be broken down (use poetryline's as appropriate):
* Oracle against Moab
  * Two chaisticoutlines divided in the following way:
    * First One
    - A v1
     - B v2a
       - C v2b-3
        - D v4-5

    * Second One
        - D' v6-7
       - C' v8
     - B' v9a
   - A' v9b

   
* Moab run to Zion
  * One biblicaloutline for the whole thing.  Just use poetrylines correctly

* Let Moab Wail
  * Let's use overview and overviewsection components for this one like we did in 13-1-14-27 with the following breakdown:
    * v6 - Pride
      * v-7-8 - Therefore #1 - Moab wail for Kir
      * v9-10 - Therefore #2 - I weep for Moab
      * v11 - Therefore #3 - I moan for Kir
    * v12-14 - Consequence of Pride
 

# Highlights (if I don't specify a color, just pick a unique one we haven't used yet):
  * "Moab" – yellow
  * "Dibon"/"Kir-hareseth"/"Heshbon"/"Jazer" – grey
  * "vine of Sibmah"
  * I want 3 variations of blue for the next three. If one doesn't exist, please create it:
    - "weep"/"tears"/"weeping"
    - "wails"/"wailing"
    - "cry out"/"cries out"/"cry"
  * "remnant"/"remain" - green
  * "high place"
  * "Therefore" - orange (also highlight in the overview component too)
  * "shout"/"shouting"

# Footnotes (using sectionwordfootnote):
chapter 15
  * v1 "undone" - "'Da'mah' - only else used in chapter 6"
  * v2 "temple" - "or 'bayith' - could be a city in Moab"
  * v2 "baldness" - "c.f. chapter 3"
  * v2 "shorn" - "c.f. chapter 7"
  * v3 "melts" - "lit. 'goes down' - contrasted with housetops"
chapter 16
  * v4 "among you" - "or 'let my outcasts dwell among you, Moab'"
  * v7 "rasin cakes" - "could be cultic significance (Hos 3:1) or just an extrapolation of v8"
  * v13 "past" - "a little glimpse into the making of Isaiah"
  * v14 "great multitude" - "c.f. 15:7"

  
# Placeholder Notes (Emphasise these are placeholders through [PLACEHOLDER]):
  * Israel's History with Moab
    - We'll read the Sodom and Gomorrah/Lot and his daughters story and touch on their history up until this point

  * How Isaiah is affected
    - We'll talk about  how his heart cries out and how he weeps in both of these chapters

  * Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah
    - Reference the last time in the bible someone fled to Zoar (Sodom story). We can also chat about what Eglath-shelishiyah means and how it could refer to the Judges story with the Moabite  King of the same name

  * Faith in Stuff
    - We can give a brief meditation on how v7 is emblematic of their problem. Faith in their status and posessions and how it relates to Israel's description earlier in Isaiah
  
  * Dibon/Dimon
    - Talk about the wordplay from Dibon to Dimon to talk about the blood

  * Lion for Moab
    - Quote the story from 2 Sam 23:30 and how "lions" have interacted with Moab before. Also talkinga bout how both Philistia and Moab's remnants have a different fate than Israel's

ch 16
  * Send the Lamb
    - Quote 2Kings 3:4 and 2 Sam 8:2 how King of Moab was a sheep breeder and Moab has brought gifts to David before
  
  * Running to Zion
    - A bigger section here around how this is all a fulfillment of ch2 of Isaiah where the nations are running to Zion. Also a larger reflection on the last time a Moabite fugitive fled to Zion for safety and how that relates to the Davidic Kingdom (Ruth)

  * Throne in steadfast love and faithfulness
    - Quote Ex. 34:6 and talka bout how it's the most quoted verse in the whole Hebrew Bible. This God is like this King

  * Vines to Wildnerness
    - A bit about the "decreation" going on here of Moab's wealth and how it's turning back into a pre-creation state. Quote Gen 1:2 here as well. Desert/wilderness and sea is where life was before creation
