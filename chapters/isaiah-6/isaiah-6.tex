{\large\bfseries Isaiah's Response to Holiness}
{\vspace{1em}}

The variety in translation of Isaiah's response reveals the depth of his spiritual crisis. The ESV's "I am lost" (Hebrew: \textit{nidmeiti}) can mean destroyed, silenced, or undone. The NASB and NIV's "ruined" emphasizes total devastation, while the KJV's "undone" suggests being unraveled or coming apart. The NET's "destroyed" is perhaps most literal. All translations capture Isaiah's recognition that encountering God's holiness exposes his complete unworthiness and need for divine intervention.

{\large\bfseries The Real King}
{\vspace{1em}}

King Uzziah had reigned for 52 years when he died, making him one of the longest-reigning kings of Judah. His death marked the end of an era of prosperity and stability. But in this moment of political uncertainty, Isaiah sees the true King - the LORD of hosts - seated on His eternal throne. This vision reminds us that earthly kings come and go, but the LORD reigns forever. See 2 Chronicles 26:16-20 for the account of Uzziah's downfall due to his pride.

{\large\bfseries Seraphim}
{\vspace{1em}}

The word "seraphim" comes from the Hebrew root meaning "to burn." These are the only creatures called seraphim in Scripture, and they are associated with purification and holiness. Interestingly, the same Hebrew word is used for the "fiery serpents" in Numbers 21:6, suggesting these beings are connected with God's purifying judgment.

TODO: Add more details about the significance of seraphim.

{\large\bfseries Guarding the Thresholds}
{\vspace{1em}}

The shaking of the thresholds recalls the cherubim who guard the entrance to Eden after the fall (Genesis 3:24). Just as angels guarded the way to the tree of life, the seraphim here guard the threshold of God's holy presence. The shaking thresholds emphasize the awesome power and holiness of God that makes His presence both wonderful and terrible.
