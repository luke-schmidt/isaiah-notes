# Intro
alright. let's do Psalm 32 here like we do with Isaiah. Let's use the ESV text like we already do everywhere else in this repo. You know what the text is so you don't need to look it up.

# Structure
Let's use overview and overviewsection components for this one like we do elsewhere (feel free to reference many other examples for how this is done):
  * A - v1-2
    * B - v3-4
  * A' - v5

  * A - v6-7
    * B - v8-9
  * A' - v10-11
 

# Highlights (if I don't specify a color, just pick a unique one we haven't used yet):
  * "Blessed"
  * "transgression(s)"/"sin"/"iniquity" - red
  * "covered"/"cover"
  * forgiven"/"forgave"
  * "LORD"
  * "everyone"/"all"
  * "godly"/"all"
  * "surround(s)"
  * "shouts of deliverance"/"shout for joy"

# Footnotes (using sectionwordfootnote):
  * "Maskil" - "musical term, maybe signaling an instructive/wisdom Psalm but most folks don't really know"
  * v1 "forgiven" - "literally 'lifted up' - compare with the heavy hand in v4"
  * v3 "groaning" - "lit. 'roaring'"
  * v4 "dried up" - "lit. 'overturned'"
  * v6 "great waters" - "often a symbol of chaos and destruction"

  
# Questions:
List the following questions like we do with note headings in other Isaiah passages, but don't put any text beneath them. Number them in order:

1. How does this Psalm relate to Psalm 1?

2. What does it mean to be blessed here and how do we use that today?

3. What does the repeated use of the word "covering" signify here? Why is it important?

4. Compare the silent vs shouting theme. What is leading David to go from silence in v3 to shouting in v11?

5. What does v9 mean when it says that "it will not stay near you"?

6. What is the close tie between "spiritual" and "physical" deliverance here? Do we view the line between these two similarly to David here?

7. Do you have a culture of confession in your life, your home, your GC? If not, how does this Psalm encourage or convict you to grow in this area?
