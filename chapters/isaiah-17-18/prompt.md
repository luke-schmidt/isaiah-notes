# Intro
Create Isaiah 17-18 .tex file with ESV text (you know the text already, no need to look it up).

## Document Setup:
- Include `\usepackage{../../styles/components/isaiahOraclesOverview}` in preamble
- Add `\isaiahOraclesOverview{4}` after title (section 4 = Damascus)

# Structure
Create overview component with these 5 sections:
* 17:1-6 - Intro/"In that Day" #1
* 17:7-8 - "In that Day" #2
* 17:9-11 - "In that Day" #3
* 17:12-14 - "Ah!" #1 and judgement "at that time"
* 18:1-7 - "Ah!" #2 and judgement "at that time"

## Biblical Outlines:
- Create separate `biblicaloutline` for 17:1-6, 17:7-8, 17:9-11, and 17:12-14
- **Title format**: Include overview description (e.g., `[Isaiah 17:1-6 — Intro/"In that Day" #1]`)
- **Do NOT include** `\subsectionheader` commands

## Chiastic Outline for 18:1-7:
- Use `chiasticoutline` with structure: A(1-2), B(3), C(4), C'(5), B'(6), A'(7)
- **Title format**: `[Isaiah 18:1-7 — "Ah!" #2 and Judgment "at that time"]`
- **Add `\\` at end of every line** for proper line breaks

Use `\poetryline` as appropriate throughout.

# Placeholder Notes (Emphasise these are placeholders through [PLACEHOLDER]):

Place the following notes under the section they most relate to:
  * Why Damascus?
    - As we read in ch 7, Damascus and the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Ephraim) are united against Judah since they didn't want to band together with them against Assyria. This oracle, as we see in the verses right after, are more general and widespread than just Damascus. This pattern is consistent with the other oracles we've read so far too.

  * For the Poor
    - Quote Deut 24:19-22 (ESV - you know it, no need to look up). This law for sure was top of mind for Isaiah when writing this. It's as if they will be like the poor they neglected in the first place!

  * Work of their hands
    - As we read in chapter 2:6-22, Israel very much put stock in what they possessed. The pattern of what happens to folks who build their own empire and rely upon it is consistent throughout all of Scripture. God will be worshipped one way or another. How is this pattern taking place in our world today? AI/Military might/Riches/etc?

  * Real Stronghold
    - Compare Isaiah's usage of the hebrew word for strong/refuge (NOTE: Use the Hebrew word component here to highlight it). Are they placing hope in their cities or their Rock of Salvation? Cities have an interesting history throughout the Bible too. Starting with the first city - Cain's - the picture of them is consistently one of folks building their own sense of security rather than trusting God's. Even cities are ultimately redeemed in the end though in the New Heavens and the New Earth
  
  * Forgotten God
    - Quote Deut 8:11-20 - Forgetting God is apostasy that leads to idol worship
    
  * Planting Plants?
    - The Pleasant Plants" could be referring to Tammuz – a pagan god worshipped by the nations at this time. The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible (Septuigent) also tranlates this as "Unfaithful plant and Unfaithful seed". Quote chatper 1:29 here too

  * Like Chaff; Like Waters
    - Quote ch. 8:7. 6. When the husks have been separated from the grains of wheat or barley the mixture is tossed into the air. The chaff is blown away while the heavier grain falls back to the ground. For this reason threshing floors were located in the most windy places, the hilltops; ef. 29:5.

ch 18
  * Whirring Wings?
    - This could be because there were a lot of bugs in this area south of Egypt, but it could also be describing messangers that move so fast in the sea like insects. The Septuigent seems to say the same thing by translating this "land of winged boats".
  
  * Who are the Ambassadors?
    - Could've been from a new dynasty in 715bc that was Cushite. ruling family could've sent envoys to juday/p;hilistia/moab to revolt against assyria? 

  * Who are they giving a message to?
    - or it could be Isaiah telling the messengers to go straight to Assyria themselves? Egypt isn't usually described this way... could be Medes? folks aren't sure. Mighty - lit. a qaw-qaw nation - hebrew gibberish to describe the ppl of Cush? do translation comparison. i think NIV gets it "right"

  * Yahew is Quietly Looking
    - Quote Mt. 13:24-30. Folks are expecting big acts of judgement. the Lord is quietly looking

  * River of Cush
    - Quote Gen 2 around the river section. This is one of the nations that in Chatper 2 of Isaiah will "river" back up. Here in v7 we see that direct fulfillment!

  * Verse 7 Fulfillment
    - Where else have we heard of people coming to know the Lord from Cush? 2 specific instances come to mind for me: 1 OT; 1 NT
      - OT - Queen of Sheba (quote relevant verses here). Coming to bring tribute to the Lord's annointed
      - NT - Ethiopian Eunic (quote relevant verses here)
    This is all fulfillment too of Ps 68:29 and 76:11 (quote these too)
