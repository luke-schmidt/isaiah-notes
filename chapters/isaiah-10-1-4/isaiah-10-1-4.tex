Isaiah's rebuke of Israel's leaders for robbing the poor and making widows and orphans their prey finds an echo in Jesus' confrontation with the religious leaders of His day:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, 'Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.'"}\\
\hfill --- Luke 20:45-47
\end{quote}

\vspace{1em}

While Jesus doesn't quote Isaiah 10 directly here, it seems that this section of Scripture was on His mind for a few reasons.

Consider the language Isaiah has been using throughout chapter 9 and into chapter 10: nations \highlightblue{devouring} Israel with \highlightblue{open mouth} (9:12), leaders causing people to be \highlightblue{swallowed up} (9:16), wickedness \highlightblue{devouring} like fire (9:18), and tribes \highlightblue{devouring} one another (9:19-21). Now in 10:2, these same predatory leaders make widows and orphans their "spoil" and "prey" ("shalal" and "baz" from ch 8)

When Jesus warns that the scribes and Pharisees "\highlightblue{devour} widows' houses," He employs this same visceral, predatory language. The repetition of "devour" throughout Isaiah 9-10, culminating in the exploitation of the vulnerable, creates a thematic thread that Jesus appears to draw upon. While not a direct quotation, the conceptual and linguistic parallels suggest this Isaiah text was very much on His mind as He confronted religious leaders who, like their ancient counterparts, used their positions to exploit rather than protect the most vulnerable—all while maintaining an outward show of piety with their "long prayers" and religious garments.

The pattern remains consistent across centuries: those entrusted with leading God's people can become their greatest predators, \highlightblue{devouring} the very ones they should defend.
