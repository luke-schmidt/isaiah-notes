alright. let's fill out 14:28-32 similar to our other chapters. Let's use the ESV text like we already do everywhere else in this repo

  Structure:
  * no overviewsection needed given size of passage

  * One chaisticoutline divided in the following way:
   - A v28
     - B v29a
       - C v29b
        - D v30a
       - C' v30b
     - B' v31
   - A' v32  
   Using poetryline's as appropriate

  Highlights:
  * "O Philistia, all of you" – yellow
  * "root" – green
  * "died"/"kill" - red

  Footnotes:
  * v29 "fiery serpent" – "Seraph – same angels from Chapter 6"
  * v30 "graze" - line could also be translated, "the poor will graze in my pastures"
  
  Placeholder Notes:
  * Who's the Rod?
    - This rather cryptic section has a lot of scholars divided on who each of the characters in this passage are. Most, like Oswalt, see significance in the dating of the prophecy in v28 in how it plays in with the rest of the passage.
      The rod that's broken though doesn't necessarily seem to be King Ahaz directly though, since Philistia was actually profitable under his rule (NOTE: Quote 2 Chron 28:18 below). Likely what this is referring to is seemingly decaying Assyrian power around the same time as Ahaz's death. So it's not necessarily Ahaz as the rod, but Assyria's power around the same time as Ahaz's death.
  
  * Who's the Serpent?
    - Given Assyria's apparant weaknesses and Philistia looking to capitalize, this oracle from Isaiah is letting them know that a larger snake-like power is still coming for them. Using the same "root" language earlier in Isaiah, he's now using it to refer to an Assyrian root leading to a snake-seed (cf. Gen 3:16).

    One other view here is from Motyer who views the root in v29 and the fruit from it is all in reference to the Messiah who will lead the punishment of Philistia at the hand of Israel (cf. ch 11)

  * Who's the Poor?
    - The poor of v30 could be a precursor to the afflicted in v32 in that Yahweh's people themselves have a home and security through Yahweh's power. Philistia seems to have been going to Judah at Ahaz's death and using it as an excuse to get Judah on board with an Assyrian revolt.
    The response of Isaiah is the same as his response to Ahaz during his life – don't trust in political alliances, trust in Yahweh Himself Who can save and give secruity to the most vulnerable and afflicted in society.
